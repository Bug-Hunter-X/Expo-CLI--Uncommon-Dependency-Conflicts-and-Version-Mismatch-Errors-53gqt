# Expo CLI: Uncommon Dependency Conflicts and Version Mismatch Errors

This repository demonstrates a scenario where uncommon errors occur in Expo CLI due to inconsistencies in dependency versions.  The issue is characterized by cryptic error messages that are not immediately obvious.  The solution involves careful version management and updating packages to ensure compatibility.

## Problem
The `uncommonExpoError.js` file shows code that might trigger an uncommon error in an Expo project. This could be due to various reasons such as using a feature from a newer React Native version or conflicting versions of libraries.

## Solution
The `uncommonExpoErrorSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the code, addressing the version mismatch and resolving the error.  This solution might include updating the Expo SDK version, upgrading other dependent libraries, or modifying the code to use compatible alternatives.

## How to Reproduce
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install`.
4. Attempt to run the app using `expo start`. (You may encounter the error here)
5. Compare the code in `uncommonExpoError.js` with `uncommonExpoErrorSolution.js` to understand the solution.

## Dependencies
Ensure all dependencies are up-to-date and compatible with your Expo SDK version.  Consult the Expo documentation for compatibility information.

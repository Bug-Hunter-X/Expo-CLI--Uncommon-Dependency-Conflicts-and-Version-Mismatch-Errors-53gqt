This error typically occurs when you're using a feature or library in Expo that isn't fully compatible with the version of React Native or other Expo modules you have installed. It might manifest as a cryptic error message during build or runtime, often related to missing modules or incorrect dependencies. For instance, you might try to use a new React Native feature that your current Expo SDK doesn't support, or there might be conflicting versions between packages.  A specific example: Using a new React Navigation library without adjusting the Expo config or updating other related dependencies.

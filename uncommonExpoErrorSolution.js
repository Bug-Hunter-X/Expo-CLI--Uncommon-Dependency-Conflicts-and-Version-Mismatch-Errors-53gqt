The solution usually involves carefully checking your `package.json` file and ensuring that all dependencies (especially React Native and related libraries) are compatible with your current Expo SDK version.  You might need to use `expo upgrade` to update the Expo SDK to the latest version.  If that doesn't work, carefully review the error messages; they sometimes point to the specific package causing the problem. You might also need to uninstall and reinstall packages to resolve version conflicts. Sometimes, using the Expo Go app might reveal additional helpful information.  Remember to consult the Expo documentation and community forums for further assistance.
